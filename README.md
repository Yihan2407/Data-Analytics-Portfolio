## About

Hey there, I'm Yi Han!  I'm currently an undergraduate at the National University of Singapore pursuing a degree in Economics with a Second Major in Business Analytics. My passion for utilizing big data and analytics to drive informed decision-making and shape consumer behavior has been a driving force in my academic pursuits. My goal is to continue growing my knowledge and skills to leverage the abundance of online data to drive positive outcomes for businesses and society as a whole.

## Stand-alone Projects

**[Spotify Insights and Recommendations Generator](https://github.com/Yihan2407/Spotify_Insights_and_Recommendations/blob/main/spotipy_recommendations.ipynb)**

After discovering [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.22.1/), a well-documented Python library for the Spotify Web API, I knew I had to tinker around with it. One area of focus I wanted to learn more about at the time was recommender systems, and so I delved right in. I learnt that Spotify has data on tracks such as acousticness, danceability, instrumentalness and speechiness, which can be used to generate recommendations based on past listening history. Here, I first generated insights using my top songs of 2022, a playlist that is automatically generated by Spotify annually, such as visualizing the data of my top genres and artists. Next, I created a recommender system using cosine similarity, which measures the similarity between two vectors. By inputting a user's playlist and another target playlist, music recommendations can be generated from the target playlist based on cosine similarity matching the initial playlist.


**[Pokémon Data Exploration: Web Scraping and Machine Learning](https://github.com/Yihan2407/pokemon_analytics)**

Here, I wanted to work on a data analytics project that was related to something of personal interest to me. Looking back to my childhood self, fond memories of Pokémon would arise. It is an extremely popular franchise that is well-known by many around the world, and is accessible regardless of age. In fact, even in 2023, Pokémon remains one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. To start off, I web scraped the data of 809 individual Pokémon from the [serebii.net](https://serebii.net/) database, transformed it and stored it as a Pandas dataframe for analysis. Then, I explored the data, performing univariate and bivariate data visualization to showcase the distribution of stats across 18 types. Lastly, I developed and evaluated multiple binary classifiers to predict the legendary status of a given Pokémon.


**[Hospital Management Database: Analytics with SQL](https://github.com/Yihan2407/healthcare-data-analytics)**

At the time, I was really curious about the various types of healthcare data stored, which led me to the course 'Data Analytics: Intro to SQL using Healthcare Data', which culminated in this final project. Using the healthcare data provided, I developed a database that centralized healthcare data including patient IDs and diagnoses, utilizing Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. Then, I queried various data using subqueries, CTEs, joins and window functions. An example query would be querying the average age of patients by gender with a diagnosis that included Type 2 diabetes.

**[120 Years of Olympic History: Data Exploration with SQL](https://github.com/Yihan2407/olympic_games_analytics/blob/main/olympic_games_analysis.sql)**

The Olympic Games possess a rich history; the first recorded, modern Olympic Games held actually dated back to 1896. Now, the Olympic Games serve as a platform where the best athletes globally may showcase their prowess at a certain sport, thereby promoting peaceful global interactions. Here, I used SQL to explore the [1896 - 2016 Olympic Games dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results) by first importing the csv file into PostgreSQL. Then, I queried various data such as the M:F Gender Ratio of each Olympic Games, incorporating methods such as subqueries, CTEs, aggregation, joins, window functions, rolling sums, CASE expressions, COALESCE, string subsetting and concatenation in my queries.

## Machine Learning Case Studies

### Classification
**[Credit Card Default Classification](https://github.com/Yihan2407/credit-default-analytics)**

Predictive analytics in finance is extremely important as it allows for the prediction of risk in lending (i.e. credit default rates) by using the existing data of clients to identify prominent trends, and thereafter make predictions that generate valuable insights. Given a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset) of 30,000 clients, we attempt to create several binary classifiers that would predict whether clients would default on their payment next month, using various factors such as demographic data, credit data and history of payment. A range of machine learning alogrithms have been implemented, including Logistic Regression, K-nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Neural Network and XGBoost. We have also applied the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique to address imbalances in the dataset and improve accuracy of predictions.

**[Cardiovascular Disease Classification](https://github.com/Yihan2407/cardiovascular_diseases_ml_project)**

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) have been on the rise; in fact, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), CVDs alone accounted for one-third of all deaths worldwide, and even posed as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 that would result in hospitalization and death. The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset) that I have used contains data on 70,000 patients, with information such as their age, height, weight and cholesterol levels, of which may be correlated to the probability of contracting cardiovascular diseases.  Here, using my prior knowledge on the risk factors of CVDs, I attempt to create several binary classifiers that would predict whether a given patient would contract cardiovascular diseases. A non-exhaustive list of risk factors include smoking, drinking, being overweight, as well as being physically inactive. The Kaggle Kernel can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/limyihan/cardiovascular-diseases-eda-and-ml-classification).

### Regression
**[House Prices Regression](https://github.com/Yihan2407/house_prices_ml_project)**

What determines the value of a property? Given 79 explanatory variables describing almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, I attempt to predict each property's sale price using regression techniques. Examples of explanatory variables include the neighborhood the property resides in, size of the garage, year it was sold, the general shape of the property as well as the above grade living area square feet. I first conducted exploratory data analysis, before proceeding onto data processing & cleaning, imputation of missing values, feature transformation as well as feature engineering to try and maximize the predictive capability of my models. Then, I experimented with several regression models such as Ridge Regression, ElasticNet Regression and Random Forest Regression. Overall, it was a really fun dataset to play around with, and the abundance of predictor variables made for some interesting ways to approach feature transformation and feature engineering.
